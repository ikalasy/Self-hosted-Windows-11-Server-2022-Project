   1. Click on `specify virtual hardware`, and drag the Base Memory to at least 7000mg (7gbs), and select at least 2 CPUs.<br /> *should look something like this* <br /> <img width="620" height="104" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edd9410-3e6e-4564-b66a-41229f86eaa9" /> 
    1. Also make sure that you have enough storage, I put 40gbs. <br /> <img width="604" height="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14b1eaa-9885-460f-9adb-3b0cb745dbc6" />
